/*
ðŸ”¹ Difficulty: 1100

You are given a string s of length n. Let's define two operations you can apply on the string:
1. remove the first character of the string;
2. remove the second character of the string.
Your task is to find the number of distinct non-empty strings that can be generated by applying the given operations 
on the initial string any number of times (possibly zero), in any order.
